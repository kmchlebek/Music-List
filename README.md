# Music-List
The program allows the viewer to see, edit, or check off tasks from a music "to-do" or to listen to list.
#How to use
To use my to-do list, you will be presented with a menu of options that the program can do for you. You will be asked what option you would like to choose from 1 through 8. After viewing, editing, checking off items from the list, etc, the to-do list program will reset and you can keep adding, removing, etc. When you are done with the to-do list, you can choose option 8 to quit the program. 
#Credits
I worked on this project with my friend, Kacper, on the side.
